HexaSwitch is a 6-channel home automation PCB designed around the ESP32-WROOM-32 module and TRIAC-based switching. It is intended for controlling household AC loads such as fans, lights, and sockets over Wi-Fi.
⚠️ Warning: This project deals with 220–240V AC mains voltage. Mishandling can cause electric shock, fire, or injury. Use only if you understand high-voltage design practices. Not certified for production use.
